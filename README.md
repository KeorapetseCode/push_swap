# push_swap
Number sorting algorithm application.
<br />
<br />
Random numbers are given as input into the program. <br />
The program has to sort the list of numbers with least moves as possible. <br />
if a certain number in the list is moved to a certain position that is regarded as a move. <br />

 # Objectives <br />
- Memory allocation in C<br />
- Data structures and algorithms in C<br />

# How To Run <br />
- $make <br />
(it will compile all the C source code and create a static archive file)
- $./push_swap 2 1 3 6 5 8  <br />
(For arguments you can add a list of numbers that are unsortted and the program will sort them and print all the moves that it executed to the standard output) min 2 - max 500 numbers.
